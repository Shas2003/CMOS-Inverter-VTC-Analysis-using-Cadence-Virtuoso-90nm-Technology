# CMOS-Inverter-VTC-Analysis-using-Cadence-Virtuoso-90nm-Technology
Performed DC parametric analysis of a CMOS inverter (90nm tech) in Cadence Virtuoso. Swept NMOS and PMOS widths to study VTC. Observed that PMOS must be wider than NMOS to balance mobility, achieve symmetric switching, and maintain proper inverter threshold (VM).
